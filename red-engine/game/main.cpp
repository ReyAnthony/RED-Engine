	 * 	The borg should have the following phases :
	 *
	 * 	1) EXPLORATION_PHASE
	 * 		During this phase, the borg is pathfinding to every reachable locations
	 * 		on the map.
	 * 		As soon as it cannot find any unvisited place anymore, the borg will go
	 * 		to the EXIT_CAVE phase.
	 *
	 * 	2) EXIT_CAVE
	 * 		The borg will go to the nearest exit point (upward if there is no downward exit)
	 *
	 * 	3) THREAT_ASSESSEMENT
	 * 		If there is enemies in the borg's line of sight, it will assess the threat.
	 * 		If the threat is LOW or NORMAL, the borg will go to the FIGHT phase.
	 * 		Otherwize, the FLEE phase is used.
	 *
	 *	4) FIGHT
	 *		The borg will try to defeat his opponents.
	 *
	 *	5) FLEE
	 *		The borg will try to loose its opponenents
	 *
	 *	6) STATUS_CHECK
	 *		Each time the borg is damaged, it performs a STATUS_CHECK.
	 *		It tries to :
	 *			- Eat
	 *			- Heal itself
	 *			- etc...
