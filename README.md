# RED-Engine
C++ Game Engine based on Allegro5 and java map editor.

Currently I tested and got it to work on : 
- OSX
- Trisquel GNU/Linux (Debian / Ubuntu based)
- Windows 7 (via mingw)

I'm looking for people to : 
- Create unit tests and do tests in general (and report bugs in the tracker)
- Ehance the graphics 
- Tidy up the C++ code 
- Write an engine to manage translated strings (we could use a .hpp file tho and #if's)
- Test the game on other OSes and different configurations

THe engine folders contains the engine and the .hpp files to be used by a game using this engine. 

Current state (Things I will likely do in short time)

- Need to do the int tests (lots of things not checked so lots of hidden bugs) 
- Ehance the laggy camera movement (and hide allegro references from the game part)
- Create a makefile ...

The map editor is not finished (no export functions for the moment, but will come in a short time)
