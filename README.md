THe engine folders contains the engine and the .hpp files to be used by a game using this engine. 
Please build using the bash files (make.sh and make_lib.sh), the CMake file don't work and is just here to contempt CLion.
I need to make a real makefile, but I'm not good at it, any help is welcome. 

Tested compiling and working on OSX 10.10.14. 

Current state (Things I will likely do in short time)

- Need to do the int tests (lots of things not checked so lots of hidden bugs) 
- Ehance the laggy camera movement (and hide allegro references from the game part)
- Create a makefile ...

The map editor is not finished (no export functions for the moment, but will come in a short time)
